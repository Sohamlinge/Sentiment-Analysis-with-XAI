# Sentiment-Analysis-with-XAI
In this extensive research, our primary focus is on sentiment analysis and the crucial role played by Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). We delve into techniques like Lime, emphasizing their impact on enhancing transparency in Logistic Regression (ML) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models within machine learning and deep learning frameworks. Our exploration aims to uncover potential biases in machine learning predictions when employing XAI and elucidate how XAI contributes to unraveling the complexities of deep learning models in sentiment analysis, drawing insights from existing research.

A notable revelation from our investigation is the gap in the literature regarding the absence of comprehensive training and interpretation for both machine learning and deep learning models on the same dataset utilizing XAI. Addressing this gap, our research provides a unique perspective, shedding light on the predictions of machine learning and deep learning models through the lens of XAI.

A key finding of our work underscores a significant distinction: despite a commendable 83% accuracy for the deep learning model, it is outperformed by the machine learning model, achieving an accuracy level of 92% in certain instances. This critical insight becomes discernible only through the application of XAI techniques, particularly the use of Lime. This emphasizes the paramount importance of transparent interpretability in evaluating model performance, showcasing the potential of XAI in unraveling nuanced aspects of predictive models.
